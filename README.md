# Skip the Fishes

This is a project for VanHack's Hackaton. The description of the challenge was focused on high performance and high availability, so I tought about a solution high scalable with API Gateway and Lambda creating a serverless architecture and a static website hosted on AWS S3 distributed on cloudfront.

This project contains a mini full stack food delivery website focused on the premises above. The architecture blueprint that I tought was:

#image-aws

# Frontend

The front-end was developed in Angular 4 using Bootstrap as css framework

Angular 2 / Flask / AWS Serverless - Web site made for a Hackaton from app.vanhack.com
